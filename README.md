# Vaccination-Management-System
In this web application where a user could create an account and manage their vaccine appointments and records. The admin users could configure new diseases, their corresponding vaccines, and add clinics where the vaccines would be available in specific time windows. The regular users could book appointments, cancel and/or reschedule them, view their appointments due by providing a future date, etc. React was used for the Frontend, Java and Spring Boot for the Backend, Spring Data JPA to handle Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), and MySQL (deployed in AWS RDS) as the database. The application supported OAuth authentication to enable login through Google and Facebook. The application was hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.
